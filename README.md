# Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for Hex Game

## Project Description

This repository contains the code for a project paper for a Master's module in the field of reinforcement learning. The aim of the project is to explore and implement Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agents to learn and play the 7x7 Hex game.

### Key Components of the Project:
- **Hex Game**: Hex is a strategic board game with a large state space and requires long-term planning, presenting a significant challenge in the field of reinforcement learning.
- **Experiments**: Six experiments were conducted to evaluate different training methodologies, focusing on various reward shaping techniques and opponent configurations.
- **Results**: The results highlighted the agentsâ€™ ability to achieve high win rates against random opponents but revealed significant challenges in adaptability and strategic depth, particularly when switching roles or facing more complex strategies.
- **Future Work**: Future work should address these challenges by simplifying reward structures, extending training durations, and incorporating periodic evaluations to enhance learning efficacy and strategic proficiency.

## Tech Stack

- **Torch**: Used for the implementation and training of the PPO agents.
